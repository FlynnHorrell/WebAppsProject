Description

Our guitar app will allow users to make chords on a diagram of a guitar, and then have the web page play a sound file to accomplany it while displaying the name of the chord and a reference for how to play it on a guitar. 

Operations

The user should be able to select and de-select strings to show if they are part of the chord.
There will be 12 frets in the diagram, and pressing a string on a different fret will change the chord being made.
The web page will be able to play the chord using HTML5 Audio. 
The user will be able to input any chord they want, and the diagram will show how to play it.
The user will also be able to use alternate tunings.
The user will be able to make chords with 7 stringed guitars (if we have the time)
